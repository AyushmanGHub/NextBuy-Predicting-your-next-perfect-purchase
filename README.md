# **Next Buy : Predicting Your Next Perfect Product**

This project focuses on building a **Recommendation System for an E-commerce Platform** to enhance user experience by suggesting products. It integrates two major approaches to recommendation:  
(a) **Content-Based Filtering** — leveraging product descriptions.  
(b) **Collaborative Filtering** — utilizing user behavior, interactions, and ratings.

The pipeline involves **Data Processing**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Model Training**, **Prediction**, and **Evaluation**. The performance of the system is measured using metrics such as **RMSE**, **Precision**, and **Recall** to assess recommendation quality.

## **Methodologies Used**

### **(a) Content-Based Filtering: Using Product Descriptions**
This approach relies on product metadata to recommend items that are similar to what the user has interacted with previously.

- **Tools & Techniques**:  
  - **Scikit-learn** for feature extraction using methods such as **TF-IDF** on item attributes like description, category, etc.  
  - **Cosine Similarity** or other similarity measures to compute distances between items based on their attributes.

- **Example**:  
  A user who has bought "wireless headphones" might be recommended "Bluetooth speakers" due to their similar features.

### **(b) Collaborative Filtering: Using User-Behavior Data**
This technique recommends items based on the past interactions of users and the behavior of other similar users.

- **Tools & Techniques**:  
  - **Scikit-Surprise** for collaborative filtering models like SVD, SVD++, NMF.  
  - **Implicit Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** for advanced matrix factorization on sparse user-item interactions.

- **Example**:  
  If User A likes a product and User B likes the same product, User A might be recommended products liked by User B.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaning and normalizing product descriptions.  
   - Encoding user and product IDs.  
   - Creating a user-item matrix.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualizing rating distributions, user activity levels, and item popularity.  
   - Understanding sparsity in the dataset.

3. **Model Training**:  
   - Training the **content-based model** using cosine similarity.  
   - Training the **collaborative filtering model** using ALS and evaluating on validation sets.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** for accuracy of predicted ratings.  
   - **Precision@K** and **Recall@K** for the quality of top-K recommendations.

5. **Model Deployment**:  
   - Combining content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations for hybrid results.  
   - Deploying models in a scalable environment for real-time predictions.

## **Features and Innovations**
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering to tackle cold-start problems.  
- **Scalable Training**: Efficient training using sparse matrices for large-scale data.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: Insights on user behavior, item popularity, and recommendation quality through dynamic dashboards.
